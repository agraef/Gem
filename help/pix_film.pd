#X text 47 323 [pix_film] loads in a digital-video to be used as a
texture \, bitblit \, or something else. You can send the open message
with a filename.;
#X text 51 381 On Windos32-platforms \, you can load only AVI-files.
On Linux-platforms \, you can load only MPEG2-files (*.MPG) and quicktime-files
(*.MOV). However \, most of the quicktime-formats might be unsupported
by Linux (not by GEM);
#X text 48 505 There is no attempt to resize the film to be a power
of 2 \, which is required for texture mapping. Use [pix_resize] if
you need this feature \, or -- less consumptive -- [pix_texture2];
#X text 46 586 "auto <state>" will start playing the movie from the
current frame. Each rendering-frame the film-frame is incremented by
one. When the last frame is reached \, a <bang> will appear on the
third outlet.;
#X text 56 455 After loading \, the number of frames is output on outlet2
if it is possible (it might not be possible with MPEG-streams);
#X text 51 660 With [pix_film] you can process the film-data with various
[pix_]-objects. However \, films are often stored in RGB- or BGR-format
\, whereas most [pix_]-objects need RGBA-data to process color-images.
You might want to use [pix_rgba] to convert your image into RGBA-space.
