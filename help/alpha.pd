uses the glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA \, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) function
from OpenGL. If you want a different blending technique \, you will
need to make your own external. The blending that [alpha] does is the
"stereotypical" blending which you will usually want. In a nutshell
\, any pixel which has an alpha component will be blended with the
pixel that is in the frame buffer \, producing the usual "colored glass"
effect. Beaware that the rendering order matters \, so you probably
want to set the gemhead order number high so that the object is rendered
after all of the non-alpha blended ones.;
