#X text 59 255 pix_buf buffers pixes. This allows you to do some processing which might require a lot of time (for example \, convolution) and store it. All images use a pull system \, so as long as nothing is modified in the pix "upstream" \, the pix_buf is still valid.;
#X text 58 348 pix_buf is only effective if it is storing a static image. If you are continually modifying the buffered pix \, then pix_buf is going to be spending a lot of time copying pixels.;
