#X text 66 310 This is potentially slow if you are trying to change
between a lot of images \, but it doesn't use a lot of texture ram.
;
#X text 65 242 [pix_imageInPlace] is slightly different than [pix_multiimage].
When you select an image to display with [pix_multiimage] \, it copies
over the image data to the pix_buffer \, which is then used by [pix_texture].
;
#X text 66 361 [pix_imageInPlace] sends all of the image data to texture
RAM when the preload message is received. This means that you cannot
process any of the pixel data \, but it is extremely quick to change
between the various images.;
#X text 64 430 Additionally \, you do not need a [pix_texture] object.
