texture mapping. GL_LINEAR is better than GL_NEAREST (but also more
computationally expensive). However \, on many machines (especially
SGIs) \, there is no speed difference.;

power_of_2 sizes. However \, it does no real (computationally expensive)
resizing but rather manipulates the texture-coordinates. So using [pix_coord]
might not give you what you really want....;
