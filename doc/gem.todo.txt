No importance should be given to the order...it is just
when I thought of things.

---------------------------- TODO -----------------------------

GENERAL
-------
only connect to tablet if gem_tablet exists
new particle objects


OBJECTS
-------
triangle_fan
stereoscopic display with hardware glasses
NURBS/bezier patches
3DstudioMax file loader
CAL3d (character animation library): to come with gem0.88
Alias|Wavefront file data
    - articulation hierarchies in Wavefront's Kinemation
    - read Preview's .mov files (an ascii list of x, y, and/or z values)
	- write my own A/W parser
morphing between alias|wavefront models
    - assume same number of points in each model

PIXES
-----
pix_dv
motion and image analysis
crop for all pix objects
    - like dimen and offset for pix_video
some way to fragment an image so that it can be used as multiple
    texture maps (hopefully arbitrary shapes, but possibly only rectangular)
pix_erosion
pix_dilation
pix_median/min/max filter
pix_lowpass
pix_highpass
video external keyer
    - three inputs - the matte and two image inputs
increased control of the Threshold object.
    - upper and lower levels adjustable
stereoscopic texture loader
pix_circle
pix_triangle
test pix_video - espec offset message

OPENGL
------
be able to switch between single and double buffering on the fly
have multiple graphics windows
increased control of view port, etc.
be able to use multiple pipes (MCO)
try out glMatrixMode(GL_TEXTURE) to deal with nonstandard texture mapping
render to a pixblock (use pbuffers or offscreen renderer)
multipass rendering
multitexturing
